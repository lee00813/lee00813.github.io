        <h3>About Me</h3>
    </article>
    <body>
        <p>I come from Hong Kong, this is my 4<sup>th</sup> year in Canada.
        <br>Before settling in Canada, my husband and I used to live in Australia and <abbr title="United States of America">USA</abbr>.
        <br>I sometimes do miss the life in Australia where I can enjoy sunshine and beach life almost all year round, but I <strong>love Canada</strong> for its cultural diversity too!
        <br>My favourite city in Canada in Montréal.</p>
        <p>
        I might not be a very active person that talks a lot, but I’m very meticulous when working towards a project. 
        <br> I care about details, from the most minor bits of the project to co-worker’s feeling. 
        <br> I’m confident that people will feel comfortable around me as I put them in my heart.
